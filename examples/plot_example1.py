Example: Use of MRC with different settings
===========================================

Example of using MRC with some of the common classification datasets with
different losses and feature mappings settings. We load the different datasets
and use 10-Fold Cross-Validation to generate the partitions for train and test.
We separate 1 partition each time for testing and use the others for training.
On each iteration we calculate the classification error as well as the upper
and lower bounds for the error. We also calculate the mean training time.

Note that we set the parameter use_cvx=False. In the case of MRC classifiers
this means that we will use nesterov subgradient optimized approach to
perform the optimization.

You can check a more elaborated example in :ref:`ex_comp`.
