    '''Double-Weighting General Covariate Shift

    The class DWGCS implements the method Double-Weighting for 
    General Covariate Shift (DWGCS) proposed in :ref:`[1] <ref1>`. 
    It is designed for supervised classification under covariate shift. 

    DW-GCS provides adaptatition to covariate shift when a set of training samples
    and a set of unlabeled samples from the testing distribution are available
    at learning, without any prior knowledge about the supports of the training
    and testing distribution.
    
    It implements 0-1 and log loss, and it can be used with multiple feature
    mappings.

    .. seealso:: For more information about DWGCS, one can refer to the
        following paper:

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : `str` {'0-1', 'log'}, default = '0-1'
        Type of loss function to use for the risk minimization. 0-1 loss
        quantifies the probability of classification error at a certain example
        for a certain rule. Log-loss quantifies the minus log-likelihood at a
        certain example for a certain rule.

    deterministic : `bool`, default = `True`
       Whether the prediction of the labels
       should be done in a deterministic way (given a fixed `random_state`
       in the case of using random Fourier or random ReLU features).

    random_state : `int`, RandomState instance, default = `None`
        Random seed used when 'fourier' and 'relu' options for feature mappings
        are used to produce the random weights.

    fit_intercept : `bool`, default = `False`
            Whether to calculate the intercept for MRCs
            If set to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
            (i.e. data is expected to be already centered).

    D : `int`, default = 4
        Hyperparameter that balances the trade-off between error in
        expectation estimates and confidence of the classification.

    B : `int`, default = 1000
        Parameter that bound the maximum value of the weights
        beta associated to the training samples.

    solver : {‘cvx’, 'grad', 'adam'}, default = ’adam’
        Method to use in solving the optimization problem. 
        Default is ‘cvx’. To choose a solver,
        you might want to consider the following aspects:

        ’cvx’
            Solves the optimization problem using the CVXPY library.
            Obtains an accurate solution while requiring more time
            than the other methods. 
            Note that the library uses the GUROBI solver in CVXpy for which
            one might need to request for a license.
            A free license can be requested `here 
            <https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/>`_

        ’grad’
            Solves the optimization using stochastic gradient descent.
            The parameters `max_iters`, `stepsize` and `mini_batch_size`
            determine the number of iterations, the learning rate and
            the batch size for gradient computation respectively.
            Note that the implementation uses nesterov's gradient descent
            in case of ReLU and threshold features, and the above parameters
            do no affect the optimization in this case.

        ’adam’
            Solves the optimization using
            stochastic gradient descent with adam (adam optimizer).
            The parameters `max_iters`, `alpha` and `mini_batch_size`
            determine the number of iterations, the learning rate and
            the batch size for gradient computation respectively.
            Note that the implementation uses nesterov's gradient descent
            in case of ReLU and threshold features, and the above parameters
            do no affect the optimization in this case.
    
    alpha : `float`, default = `0.001`
        Learning rate for ’adam’ solver.

    mini_batch_size : `int`, default = `1` or `32`
        The size of the batch to be used for computing the gradient
        in case of stochastic gradient descent and adam optimizer.
        In case of stochastic gradient descent, the default is 1, and
        in case of adam optimizer, the default is 32.

    max_iters : `int`, default = `100000` or `5000` or `2000`
        The maximum number of iterations to use in case of
        ’grad’ or ’adam’ solver.
        The default value is
        100000 for ’grad’ solver and
        5000 for ’adam’ solver and 
        2000 for nesterov's gradient descent.  

    weights_alpha : `array`, default = `None`
        The weights alpha(x) associated to each testing instance.
        Note that if just weights_beta is given, 
        method will assume they are obtained 
        based on robust approach, and fix beta(x) = 1.

    weights_beta : `beta`, default = `None`
        Weights beta(x) associated to each training sample.
        Note that if just weights_beta is given, 
        method will assume they are obtained 
        based on reweighted approach, and fix alpha(x) = 1. 

    phi : `str` or `BasePhi` instance, default = 'linear'
        Type of feature mapping function to use for mapping the input data.
        The currenlty available feature mapping methods are
        'fourier', 'relu', and 'linear'.
        The users can also implement their own feature mapping object
        (should be a `BasePhi` instance) and pass it to this argument.
        Note that when using 'fourier' feature mapping,
        training and testing instances are expected to be normalized.
        To implement a feature mapping, please go through the
        :ref:`Feature Mapping` section.

        'linear'
            It uses the identity feature map referred to as Linear feature map.
            See class `BasePhi`.

        'fourier'
            It uses Random Fourier Feature map. See class `RandomFourierPhi`.

        'relu'
            It uses Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) features.
            See class `RandomReLUPhi`.

    **phi_kwargs : Additional parameters for feature mappings.
                Groups the multiple optional parameters
                for the corresponding feature mappings(`phi`).

                For example in case of fourier features,
                the number of features is given by `n_components`
                parameter which can be passed as argument -
                `DWGCS(loss='log', phi='fourier', n_components=300)`

                The list of arguments for each feature mappings class
                can be found in the corresponding documentation.
