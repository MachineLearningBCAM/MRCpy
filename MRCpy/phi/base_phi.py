class BasePhi():

    '''
    Base class for feature mappings

    The class provides a base for different feature mapping functions
    that can be used with the MRC.
    This class provides definition for some utility functions that are
    used by the MRCs in the library. It corresponds
    to the usual identity feature map referred to as Linear feature map.

    To see an example of how to extend the class `BasePhi` to implement
    yout own feature mapping see :ref:`this example <ex_phi>`.



    .. note:: This is a base class for all the feature mappings.
        To create a new feature mapping that can be used with MRC objects,
        the user can extend this class and then implement the functions -

            1) `fit` - learns the required parameters for feature
                transformation
            2) `transform` - transforms the input instances to the features

        The above functions are principal components
        for different feature transformation.
        Apart from these functions, the users can also re-define other
        functions
        in this class according to their need.

        The definition of `fit` and `transform` in this class correspond to the
        usual identity feature map referred to as **Linear feature map**.

        The `transform` function is only used by the `eval_xy` function
        of this class to get the one-hot encoded features.
        If the user defines his own `eval_xy` function
        that returns the features directly without the need
        of `transform` function, then the `transform` function can be omitted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_classes : `int`
        Number of classes in the dataset

    fit_intercept : `bool`, default = `True`
        Whether to calculate the intercept.
        If set to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (i.e. data is expected to be already centered)

    one_hot : `bool`, default = `False`
        Controls the method used for evaluating the features of the
        given instances in the binary case.
        Only applies in the **binary case**, namely, only when there are two
        classes. When set to true, one-hot-encoding will be used. If set to
        false a more efficient shorcut will be performed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    is_fitted_ : `bool`
        Whether the feature mapping has learned its hyperparameters (if any)
        and the length of the feature mapping is set.

    len_ : `int`
        Length of the feature mapping vector.

    '''

    def __init__(self, n_classes, fit_intercept=True, one_hot=False):

        self.n_classes = n_classes
        self.fit_intercept = fit_intercept
        self.one_hot = one_hot

    def fit(self, X, Y=None):
        '''
        Performs training stage.

        Learns the required hyperparameters
        for the feature mapping transformation
        from the training instances
        and set the length of the feature mapping (one-hot encoded)
        obtained from the `eval_xy` function.

        .. note:: If a user implements `fit` function in his own feature
              mapping, then it is recommended to call this `fit` function
              at the end of his own function to automatically set
              the length of the feature mapping.
              This `fit` function can be called in a subclass as follows -

                                `super().fit(X,Y)`

              Feature mappings implemented in this library follow this
              same approach.
