    '''
    Solves the MRC problem
    using different types of solvers available in CVXpy

    Parameters
    ----------
    objective : `cvxpy` variable of `float` value
        Minimization objective function of the
        problem of the MRC.

    constraints : `array`-like of shape (`n_constraints`)
        Constraints for the MRC optimization.

    mu : `cvxpy` array of shape (number of featuers in `phi`)
        Parameters used in the optimization problem

    cvx_solvers : List of alternate cvx solvers to use for
              solving the optimization in case of failure.

    Returns
    -------
    mu_ : `array`-like of shape (number of featuers in `phi`)
        Value of the parameters
        corresponding to the optimum value of the objective function.

    objective_value : `float`
        Optimized objective value.
