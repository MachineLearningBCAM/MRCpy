`MRCpy <https://github.com/MachineLearningBCAM/MRCpy>`_ is an open-source Python library for Supervised Classification in Machine Learning. It provides implementation for recently proposed Minimax Risk Classifiers (MRCs) based on robust risk minimization and 0-1-loss, and provide bounds on the classification error. It provides a unified user-friendly interface for different variant of MRCs. The library also comes with a feature mapping module that provides implementation for some recent feature mapping methods.
