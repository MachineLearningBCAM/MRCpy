`MRCpy <https://github.com/MachineLearningBCAM/MRCpy>`_ library implements minimax risk classifiers (MRCs) that are based on robust risk minimization and can utilize 0-1-loss. Such techniques give rise to a manifold of classification methods that can provide tight bounds on the expected loss. MRCpy provides a unified interface for different variants of MRCs and follows the standards of popular Python libraries. The presented library also provides implementation for popular techniques that can be seen as MRCs such as L1-regularized logistic regression, zero-one adversarial, and maximum entropy machines. In addition, MRCpy implements recent feature mappings such as Fourier, ReLU, and threshold features.

`MRCpy <https://github.com/MachineLearningBCAM/MRCpy>`_ library incorporates a variety of datasets, along with descriptions and convenient loader functions for each dataset. More information about loaders is available in Dataset Loaders :ref:`load`. The available datasets from the `UCI Repository <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php>`_ are: credit, diabetes, ecoli, glass, haberman, indian liver patient, iris, letter recognition, mammographic, optdigits, redwine, satellite and segment. 

There also be several datasets realated to computer vision which are actually "feature datasets". We obtained these features by using a pretrained neural network over the images and taking the features from the second last layer. You can check more about this in our examples :ref:`featureextraction` and :ref:`feature_mrc`.
The image dataset `Yearbook dataset <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html>`_ is available both in its original version consisting of portrait images and in extracted features form in a CSV file. There are also feature datasets of `MNIST <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`_ and `Cats vs Dogs <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765>`_ datasets which images versions are directly available using `Tensorflow Datasets <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview>`_. For all these feature datasets we used a pretrained ResNet18 over ImageNet.
